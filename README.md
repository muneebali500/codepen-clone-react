#### GitHub Pages

The project was deployed to GitHub Pages following these steps:

1. On the navbar, hit the plus button, the drop-down option will appear. Select the "new repository" option
2. On the "create a new repository" page, enter repository name in the "Repository name" box and hit the "Create repository" button at the end
3. Create a new repository on the command line/VS code terminal in the root of the project folder using the following command lines.
   - git init
   - git add.
   - git commit -m "write your comment here within quotes"
   - git branch -M main 
   - git remote add origin {enter URL of your repository here without brackets}
   - git push -u origin main

#### Forking the repository

1. Log in to GitHub and navigate to this project's repository: [word-counter-clone](muneebali500/word-counter-clone-react)
2. Just above the navigation menu of the repository (above the Settings button) locate the Fork button
3. The original copy of the repository is now copied on your GitHub account which allows you to view and/or work on the codes without affecting the original work
